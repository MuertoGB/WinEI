## About
> ðŸ›ˆ Application is currently in late development. Pre-alpha development almost over.

Formerly known as **Xiret**, WinEI serves as a straightforward tool developed to substitute the Windows Experience Index User Interface, which was removed in Windows 8.1. This tool offers a user-friendly interface, is entirely free of advertisements and spam, and is available for free. It is compatible with all Windows versions capable of running the Experience Index. This application is a complete rewrite of [Xiret](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/xiret.html), now in C#.
